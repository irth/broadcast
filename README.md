# broadcast

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/irth/broadcast.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/irth/broadcast) [![Tests](https://github.com/irth/broadcast/actions/workflows/go.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/irth/broadcast/actions/workflows/go.yml)

A library that provides broadcast channels (one to many).

I'll write up some examples and docs later, for now I only extracted it from [OvenCast](https://github.com/irth/ovencast) which the package was originally created for.

**Probably not production-ready.**
